Pugpig Preview App Server

### What is the Pugpig Preview App Server?

Editorial, marketing, and Pubwerks need to review digital editions for magazines on iOS devices before issues are 
released. We sign preview apps with a corporate cert and need to distribute them to people. This server uses email
addresses and passwords to ensure that only authorized people download the preview apps to review the content. 
Apple requires that apps distributed with corporate certs use a signed SSL cert, so this server has one included.
